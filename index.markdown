I am a PhD candidate in the mechanical and aerospace engineering department at the University of Florida. I work in the Vehicle Dynamics and Optimization Lab [(VDOL)](http://www.anilvrao.com/Research.html) under my advisor Dr. Anil Rao. My research is in the area of optimal control with a focus on computational methods for nonsmooth and singular optimal control and  relevance to complex aerospace applications.
