I currently am an aerospace engineer at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory where my work involves further advancing trajectory optimization methods for various aerospace applications. I received a PhD in aerospace engineering from the University of Florida in August 2022 where I worked in the Vehicle Dynamics and Optimization Laboratory [(VDOL)](http://www.anilvrao.com/Research.html ) under Dr. Anil Rao. I received my BSE and MS from the University of Florida in 2018 and 2020, respectively. 

My research interests are broadly in the areaa of computational and numerical methods for optimal control, with a strong emphasis on nonsmooth and singular systems with applications to aerospace problems. My overall goal is to develop new computational tools that solve nonsmooth and singular optimal control problems. The intent of doing so is to obtain optimal and sub-optimal solutions of nonsmooth and singular problems across a wide spectrum of applications.
