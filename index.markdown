Elisha Pager graduated with a Bachelor of Science in aerospace engineering from the University of Florida (UF) in May 2018. She began graduate level study in the Department of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering at UF and joined the Vehicle Dynamics and Optimization Laboratory [(VDOL)](http://www.anilvrao.com/Research.html) in August 2018. Her interests include computational and
numerical methods for solving singular optimal control problems and applications for optimal control theory. She received her Master of Science in mechanical engineering from UF in May 2020. Shortly after, she was selected to join the Graduate Scholars Program (GSP) at The Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory where she
spends her summers working on foundational research in guidance, navigation, and control methods for hypersonic vehicles. She is on track to receive her Doctor of Philosophy in aerospace engineering from UF in August 2022.
